There is a debate between assistant and user.
Your job is to Check if the assistant is sending correct signal.
The conversation is about the 
topic:  “ <TOPIC> ” 
claim: "<CLAIM>"
reason: "<REASON>"
I want you to check if the message means that the user is convinced (agree) the claim ”<CLAIM>" is correct or not. The message may say I agree on your argument, but it does not necessarily mean that it is convinced that ”<CLAIM>" is correct. If the message is convinced on claim: “<CLAIM>" send <CONVINCED> otherwise <NOT-CONVINCED>
Only and ONLY Send <CONVINCED> or <NOT-CONVINCED> . Never send both of them. Never ever say anything else. 
Here is the format of your response:

<CONVINCED> or <NOT-CONVINCED>
